# Ask @JustDevZero anything!

A repository to ask [@JustDevZero](https://twitter.com/JustDevZero) anything.

This is a repository to a little ask-me-anything. It's forked from
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and I preffer this idea over the classics ASK.fm, formspring, etc...
Also, i feel more confortable with an issue tracker than with this systems.

I actually work at 1st Technical Support for a huge hosting company, whose name we all know but can't say, and I lead the team at my personal company (wip yet) [LSYS Network](http://lsys.es) as it's core developer.

I'm currently a Fedora & FreeBSD user, but I love to test any distros, and/or operative systems.

If you have any technical problems with one of the company projects, you're better off 
[asking LSYS Network Support directly](http://lsys.es/contacto), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/justdevzero/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/justdevzero/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
